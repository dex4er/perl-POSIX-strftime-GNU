NAME

    POSIX::strftime::GNU - strftime with GNU extensions

SYNOPSIS

      use POSIX::strftime::GNU;
      use POSIX 'strftime';
      print POSIX::strftime('%a, %d %b %Y %T %z', localtime);

    command line:

      C:\> set PERL_ANYEVENT_LOG=filter=debug
      C:\> perl -MPOSIX::strftime::GNU -MAnyEvent -e "AE::cv->send"

DESCRIPTION

    This is a wrapper for POSIX::strftime which implements more character
    sequences compatible with GNU systems.

    The module is 100% compatible with format of date(1) command from GNU
    coreutils package.

    It can be helpful if you run some software on operating system where
    these extensions, especially %z sequence, are not supported, i.e. on
    Microsoft Windows. On such system some software can work incorrectly,
    i.e. logging for Plack and AnyEvent modules might be broken.

    Even GNU C Library's strftime(3) function does not provide 100%
    compatibility with date(1) command so this module can be useful also on
    Linux.

    The XS module is used if compiler is available and can module can be
    loaded. The XS is mandatory if PERL_POSIX_STRFTIME_GNU_XS environment
    variable is true.

    The PP module is used when XS module can not be loaded or
    PERL_POSIX_STRFTIME_GNU_PP environment variable is true.

    None of these modules are loaded if both PERL_POSIX_STRFTIME_GNU_PP and
    PERL_POSIX_STRFTIME_GNU_XS environment variables are defined and false.

INSTALLING

 Cygwin

    This module requires libcrypt-devel package.

BUGS

    Timezone name is guessed with several heuristics so it can differ from
    timezone name returned by date(1) command.
