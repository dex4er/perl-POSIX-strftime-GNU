NAME
    POSIX::strftime::GNU - strftime with GNU extensions

SYNOPSIS
      use POSIX::strftime::GNU;
      use POSIX 'strftime';
      print POSIX::strftime('%a, %d %b %Y %T %z', localtime);

    command line:

      C:\> set PERL_ANYEVENT_LOG=filter=debug
      C:\> perl -MPOSIX::strftime::GNU -MAnyEvent -e "AE::cv->send"

DESCRIPTION
    This is a wrapper for POSIX::strftime which implements more character
    sequences compatible with GNU systems.

    It can be helpful if you run some software on operating system where
    these extensions, especially `%z' sequence, are not supported, i.e. on
    Microsoft Windows. On such system some software can work incorrectly,
    i.e. logging for Plack and AnyEvent modules might be broken.

    The XS module is used if compiler is available and can module can be
    loaded. The XS is mandatory if `PERL_POSIX_STRFTIME_GNU_XS' environment
    variable is true.

    The PP module is used when XS module can not be loaded or
    `PERL_POSIX_STRFTIME_GNU_PP' environment variable is true.
